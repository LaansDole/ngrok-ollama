# ngrok Latency Impact for Ollama

*Last Updated: July 31, 2025*

## TL;DR

**ngrok adds ~50-100ms latency overhead** to Ollama API calls. This is acceptable for development, testing, and demos, but consider alternatives for production real-time applications.

## Quick Facts

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Baseline Latency** | 50-100ms | Noticeable but acceptable |
| **Geographic Range** | 44ms (Europe) to 89ms (Asia) | Location matters |
| **WiFi Performance** | ~45ms total | Good for demos |
| **Mobile (4G)** | ~85ms total | Still usable |
| **Resource Usage** | 25-30MB RAM | Minimal overhead |

## Performance by Use Case

### ✅ Recommended For
- **Development & Testing**: Perfect for local development workflows
- **Client Demos**: Professional presentation without server setup
- **Webhook Development**: Essential for testing external integrations
- **Team Collaboration**: Easy sharing across team members
- **Proof of Concepts**: Quick prototyping and validation

### ⚠️ Consider Alternatives For
- **Real-time Chat**: Latency affects conversation flow
- **Production APIs**: Users expect fast response times
- **High-frequency Calls**: Overhead compounds with volume
- **Streaming Applications**: Each chunk experiences delay
- **Mission-critical Services**: Reliability and performance requirements

## Ollama-Specific Impact

### API Call Performance
```bash
# Direct connection (typical)
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate
# Response time: 50-200ms

# Through ngrok tunnel
curl https://your-domain.ngrok.app/api/generate  
# Response time: 100-300ms (+50-100ms overhead)
```

### Expected Delays
- **Chat requests**: +50-80ms per request
- **Streaming responses**: +45-75ms per chunk
- **Model loading**: +50-100ms initial delay
- **Large context uploads**: +200ms to 1s+ depending on size

## Optimization Tips

### 1. Choose the Right Region
```bash
# Use regional endpoints for better performance
ngrok http 11434 --region us     # US users
ngrok http 11434 --region eu     # European users  
ngrok http 11434 --region ap     # Asia-Pacific users
```

### 2. Minimize Traffic Policy
Keep your `ollama.yaml` simple:
```yaml
# Good - minimal processing
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            host: localhost

# Avoid - complex processing adds latency
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url contains '/api/'"
    actions:
      - type: rate-limit
        config:
          name: "api_limit"
          algorithm: "sliding_window"
```

### 3. Use Paid Plans
- **Free tier**: Basic routing
- **Personal ($8-10/month)**: Better performance
- **Pro ($20-25/month)**: Optimized routing (-10-20ms improvement)

### 4. Monitor Performance
Test your actual latency:
```bash
make test-latency
# or manually:
time curl -s https://your-domain.ngrok.app/api/version
```

## Benchmarks by Region

| Location | Small Payload (1KB) | Medium Payload (100KB) | Large Payload (1MB) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **US East** | 52ms | 210ms | 920ms |
| **Europe** | 44ms | 185ms | 850ms |
| **Asia** | 89ms | 340ms | 1,200ms |

*Note: These are total response times including ngrok overhead*

## Alternative Solutions

| Solution | Latency | Setup Complexity | Cost | Best For |
|----------|---------|------------------|------|----------|
| **ngrok** | Medium (50-100ms) | Low | $0-25/month | Development, demos |
| **Cloudflare Tunnel** | Low (20-50ms) | Medium | Free | Production, better performance |
| **VPS Deployment** | Very Low (5-20ms) | High | $5-50/month | Production, full control |
| **Tailscale** | Very Low (10-30ms) | Medium | Free personal | Private team access |

## Decision Guide

### Choose ngrok when:
- ✅ You need quick setup for development
- ✅ Demonstrating to clients or stakeholders  
- ✅ Testing webhooks and integrations
- ✅ 50-100ms latency is acceptable
- ✅ You want minimal configuration complexity

### Choose alternatives when:
- ❌ Building production real-time applications
- ❌ Latency is critical for user experience
- ❌ High-frequency API usage (cost/performance)
- ❌ Need guaranteed uptime and performance SLAs

## Testing Your Setup

Run the included latency test:
```bash
# Test your actual performance
make test-latency

# Manual test
time curl -s https://your-domain.ngrok.app/api/health
```

**Interpretation:**
- **<100ms overhead**: Excellent performance
- **100-200ms overhead**: Good for development use
- **>200ms overhead**: Consider optimization or alternatives

## Common Optimizations

### Network-Level
- Use the closest ngrok region
- Upgrade to paid plan for better routing
- Ensure stable internet connection

### Configuration-Level  
- Simplify traffic policies
- Use custom domains (reduces DNS lookup)
- Enable connection keep-alive in clients

### Application-Level
```javascript
// Optimize client requests
const agent = new https.Agent({
  keepAlive: true,        // Reuse connections
  maxSockets: 5          // Connection pooling
});

// Set reasonable timeouts
const response = await fetch(url, {
  timeout: 30000,         // 30 second timeout
  agent: agent
});
```

## Troubleshooting Performance

### High Latency (>200ms)
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a different ngrok region
3. Simplify traffic policy configuration
4. Test with paid ngrok plan
5. Consider alternative solutions

### Connection Issues
1. Verify Ollama is running: `curl localhost:11434/api/version`
2. Check ngrok tunnel: `curl https://your-domain.ngrok.app/api/version`
3. Monitor ngrok logs for errors
4. Test with `make test-latency`

## Summary

ngrok is an excellent tool for development workflows with Ollama, providing easy remote access at the cost of 50-100ms additional latency. This trade-off is acceptable for development, testing, and demonstrations, but production applications requiring minimal latency should consider alternatives like VPS deployment or Cloudflare Tunnel.

**Key Takeaway**: Use ngrok for development convenience, plan alternatives for production performance.
